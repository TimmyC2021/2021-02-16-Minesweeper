# 2021-02-16-Minesweeper

A game based on the classic PC game Minesweeper. You have to try and workout where all the 
mines are in as quick a time as possible. 

Click the left mouse button on a square to see if it is mined.

If it is then game over.

If it's not then a number will appear telling you how many mines are 
adjacent to that square. If there are no mines immediately adjacent then
all the surrounding squares will be automatically tested.

If you suspect a square has a mine in it then right click the mouse on
the square to mark it with a flag.
